		<h3>
			My name is Kalee Eversole. I design &amp; develop modern web sites &amp;
			web experiences.
		</h3>
		<p>I love everything about the web. I design and build web sites
		that are beautiful, useful and simple.</p>
		<p>I like things better when they aren't sucky, so I build for the web with this in mind.
	     I do both user interface design and front-end development. There is something magical about doing both.
	     I always trust my work is tailor-made from beginning to end. 
			   </p>
		<p>Lastly, I am a real human being. I have great husband and the most whimsical, adorable son.
			I love laughing, good moods, my friends, beer and tacos.</p>
